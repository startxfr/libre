We are happy to report that On-Premise infrastructure {{ libre_session.id }}
was successfully \e[1m\e[32mprovisioned\e[0m on On-Premise infrastructure.

Here are some interesting characteristics of this infrastructure:

Instructor: instructor.{{ libre_infra.network.dns }}"
Student   : student.{{ libre_infra.network.dns }}"
username  : {{ libre_infra.ssh.user }}"

1. Review and complete the generated inventory {{config_libre.directory.conf}}/inventory/*.yml
   $ ls -la {{config_libre.directory.conf}}/inventory/*.yml
2. Start post-provisioning your infrastructure by executing the following command :"
   $ libre-infra prem post-provision

Have a happy setup ;)
